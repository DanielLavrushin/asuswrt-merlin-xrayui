# XRAYUI Changelog

## [0.58.0] - 2025-08-0x

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: A **DNS leak protection**: a new toggle at `General Settings` → `DNS` → `Prevent DNS leaks` that forces the router to send DNS only through Xray and disables alternate system resolvers. This switch does not create the DNS inbound for you—configure a dedicated DNS inbound first For setup steps, refference [this guide](https://daniellavrushin.github.io/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/en/dns-leak)

## [0.57.1] - 2025-08-01

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: Domains from the rules where destination is `BLACKHOLE` are now correctly set in the IPSET when using `Redirect` mode.
- FIXED: GeoIP subnet lists are now properly unpacked and loaded into IPSET, including large lists.

## [0.57.0] - 2025-07-30

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Tag autocomplete for `Geosite `/` GeoIP` rules. While editing a rule, start typing `geosite:`, `geoip:` or `ext:xrayui:` and XRAYUI will instantly suggest matching tags, fetched on the fly from the installed geodat files.
- ADDED: Broader rule coverage – IP ranges referenced by `geoip:` rules are now added to `IPSET` along with domains, so both domain‑based and address‑based traffic are handled consistently (both in ipset `redirect` and `bypass` modes).
- IMPROVED: Much faster rule generation – applying the `IPSET` rules now finishes in about a second instead of nearly a minute to infinity.
- UPDATED: The internal `v2dat` geodata util [updated to version 2.2.0](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/v2dat/releases/tag/v2.2.0).

## [0.56.2] - 2025-07-29

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- IMPROVED: Exclude blocked domains from the `IPSET` rules in `REDIRECT` mode. This should boost performance during xrayui startup when `IPSET` mode is set to `REDIRECT`.
- IMPROVED: Devices List in the R/B Policies window.
- FIXED: Some routers missing the `base64` util now get it installed if it’s not present.
- FIXED: Correctly parse `Shadowsocks` subscriptrion in the `Outbounds`.

## [0.56.1] - 2025-07-27

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: `Subscription Sources`. A new `Subscriptions` tab has been added to `General Settings`. Add subscription source links that contain one or more outbound protocol descriptors (e.g., ss://, vmess://, vless://). Links with Base64‑encoded content are also supported. After adding sources, press the `Fetch` button next to the field to load the outbound links. When finished, XRAYUI will show a drop‑down field in the Outbound modal window.
- ADDED: Full subscription link support. XRAYUI now auto‑detects and parses JSON or Base64 subscription URLs. Supports `VLESS`, `VMess`, `Trojan`, and `Shadowsocks`. Paste the link in the Outbound modal form.
- ADDED: It is now possible to select the Outbound tag in the Transparent Proxy (`sockopt`) window (`DealerProxy` setting).
- FIXED: `XHTTP` Transport now correctly saves to the configuration. [#180](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/issues/180)
- FIXED: The `Complete setup` action in the import window was broken.
- FIXED: Import failed when a protocol URL had incomplete parameters.
- FIXED: Not all devices were listed in `Routing Policies`. ([#190](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/issues/190))
- ADDED: Introduced a new checkbox option,`Keep my rules and policies`, to retain existing routing rules during configuration imports. Updated the import logic to support this feature.
- IMPROVED: Import window refactored. Improved file handling and parsing for configuration imports (e.g., JSON and QR code support) with better error handling and user alerts.
- IMPROVED: Display a more accurate configuration size.
- IMPROVED: `Sockopt` (Transparent Proxy) window translated into several languages.

## [0.55.0] - 2025-07-24

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: a `Rules Filter` feature to help you quickly find a specific rule in the list. Available in the bottom-left corner of the `Routing Rules` window.
- ADDED: Start Xray with `nice -n 19` and `ionice -c3` to minimize CPU and disk I/O contention with other system processes.
- ADDED: A new `Time Delay` option in `General Settings`. This value in seconds delays the heavy XRAYUI settings from being applied after the XRAY service starts. The optimal delay may vary by router model; a 10–20 second delay is recommended for low/mid-range routers. Default is `10 seconds`. This delay can help to reduce the CPU spikes on XRAY start/restart.
- CHANGED: Removed the `flow` user property from `VLESS` Outbound when set to `none`.
- IMPROVED: Geosite File Extraction Tool: Achieved a 20x performance improvement in the [v2dat](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/v2dat/releases/tag/v2.0.0) tool.
- IMPROVED: Made minor improvements to the firewall settings.
- IMPROVED: Policy Rework: Policies now exhibit smarter behavior for better network routing.

- FIXED: DNS packets from certain LAN subnets are now reinjected into the chain instead of being dropped.
- FIXED: `IPv4/IPv6` subnet ranges are parsed correctly again.
- FIXED: Per‑device MAC‑address rules are once more inserted into iptables, restoring MAC‑based bypass/redirect behavior.
- IMPROVED: Logs modal window has been refactored.

## [0.53.2] - 2025-07-20

- ADDED: Enhanced `IPv6` support — DNS/DHCPv6 and ICMPv6 traffic are automatically excluded.
- IMPROVED: Faster, more stable IP-to-domain-name resolution in logs.
- IMPROVED: Logs now show the device nickname (if set) instead of the raw hostname.
- IMPROVED: Refactored `Clients Online` component; uses the Xray API, reports active users accurately, and reduces router CPU/RAM usage.
- REMOVED: UDP port `80` has been dropped from the default port list in Policies Manager.

## [0.52.1] - 2025-06-22

- REMOVED: UDP port `80` has been removed from the default port list in the Policies Manager.

## [0.51.0] - 2025-06-08

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: `FakeDNS` support — create and manage xray-core FakeDNS objects. _Visible only when at least one inbound is in **tproxy** mode; shows up as a “Fake DNS” row in **DNS**._
- ADDED: Feature to associate `DNS` servers with specific routing rules (available in `Advanced mode`) to simplify domain management - this include now the IPs from the rules.
- ADDED: Drag-and-drop reordering for `inbounds`.
- ADDED: Drag-and-drop reordering for `outbounds`.
- ADDED: Drag-and-drop reordering for `device policies`.
- REMOVED: Old sort buttons on inbounds and outbounds (replaced by drag-and-drop).
- REMOVED: 60 seconds delay on router reboot (experemental).

## [0.50.3] - 2025-06-07

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- IMPROVED: Sort `ipset` rules and remove duplicate entries.
- FIXED: Enhance interface list generation in set_route_localnet function for improved handling of wireless interfaces

## [0.50.1] - 2025-06-05

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: Simple routing rules that have no domains are now automatically removed from the configuration, so Xray no longer routes all traffic through them.

## [0.50.0] - 2025-05-31

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- IMPROVED: Removed explicit restart of the `firewall` and `dnsmasq` services.
- IMPROVED: Move startup to the post-mount event.
- ADDED: Introduce a new feature: `Advanced/Simple` toggle. A new button in the top-right corner lets you switch between Advanced and Simple modes. `Advanced mode` retains full access to every option (default). `Simple mode` surfaces only the most common Xray settings for VLESS/VMess proxies, making quick edits easier. `Heads-up`: If your configuration depends on less-common settings, stay in Advanced mode — hanging them in Simple mode may trigger unexpected errors.
- ADDED: Added drag-and-drop sorting to the rules list: users can now grab the dotted handle of any rule, drag it up or down, and drop it to instantly change the order. [#125](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/issues/125)
- FIXED: Don't interfere with global fonts. [#130](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/issues/130)

## [0.49.4] - 2025-05-07

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- IMPROVED: Removed explicit restart of the `firewall` and `dnsmasq` services.

## [0.49.3] - 2025-05-06

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- IMPROVED: Settings page could fail to open when hidden formatting codes were present in the stored data. These codes are now removed before the page processes the information, ensuring reliable loading.
- IMPROVED: Backup configuration file on saving. Now XRAYUI stores 3 last backups in the `/opt/etc/xray/` directory. Just in case :).
- FIXED: Secondary WAN IPv4 addresses are now detected correctly, even on firmware versions that store them under the older wanX_ipaddr variable. This ensures both WAN links are taken into account when creating exclusion rules for the firewall.

## [0.49.2] - 2025-05-04

- FIXED: Ensure xray proc is running to apply heavy `bypass`/`redirect` ipsec configurations during the `dnsmasq` restarts.

## [0.49.1] - 2025-05-04

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- IMPROVED: `DNS → ipset` engine updated with a clear three-mode switch. Modes `off`, `bypass`, and `redirect` provide, respectively, no ipset handling, whitelist-style bypassing, or smart-proxy redirection. Early-return and TPROXY rules are generated dynamically, ensuring that only traffic matching the selected mode is processed by Xray.
- IMPROVED: The process that generates the `dnsmasq` configuration and populates it with domain entries now completes significantly faster, reducing overall dnsmasq service restart time.

## [0.49.0] - 2025-05-04

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: Missing shebang when `/jffs/scripts/file` is initially empty.
- FIXED: Bug when updating a specific _xray-core_ version from the CLI.
- FIXED: Made the `dnsmasq` config-update task synchronous.
- FIXED: Complete rework of the `xhttp` transport ([#121](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/issues/121)).
- ADDED: Ability to update to **pre-release** and **draft** versions.
- ADDED: **Enable DNS bypass (ipset)** — adds a `dnsmasq` + `ipset` layer in front of Xray; domains routed via `FREEDOM` are resolved into an ipset and hit an early `RETURN` rule, so the router handles them directly and Xray stays idle for that traffic.

## [0.48.5] - 2025-04-29

- REMOVED: rules excluding `STUN` (WebRTC) traffic.
- REMOVED: the priority `101` parameter in the `ip rule add` command for policy rules.

## [0.48.0] - 2025-04-29

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Verify the readiness of the router's `JFFS` partition during installation, ensuring that required configurations are enabled.
- IMPROVED: Enhance `TPROXY` rules and improve exclusion handling in firewall configuration.
- ADDED: Added rules to exclude traffic destined for the router's IP on `UDP` port `53`.
- ADDED: Enhanced `TPROXY` rules by introducing connection marking for locally-owned `UDP` sockets and saving marks to improve traffic handling.
- ADDED: Added rules to exclude traffic for specific tunnel UDP ports (`500`, `4500`, `51820`).

## [0.47.11] - 2025-04-27

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- IMPROVED: Increase maxlength for web socket transport `path` and `host` inputs to allow longer values (up to 256 characters).
- FIXED: Firewall rules by clamping MSS for Xray-originated TCP flows and adding new rules for `IPsec` IKE/NAT-T traffic
- FIXED: `bypass` policies were ignored in `TPROXY` mode.

## [0.47.2] - 2025-04-27

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- IMPROVED: `IPv6` rules handling.

## [0.47.1] - 2025-04-27

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: `IPv6` support.
- ADDED: Added a rule to clamp the `TCP MSS` to the path `MTU` for all forwarded SYN packets in both `IPv4` and `IPv6`. This improves TCP performance by avoiding fragmentation.
- IMPROVED: Diagnostics provides more useful information.

## [0.46.6] - 2025-04-25

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Added a safety check that blocks deletion of a proxy while it is still referenced by any firewall/routing rule.
- IMPROVED: Re-factored the iptables module: local-subnet exclusion rules are now generated in a single, cleaner block for easier maintenance and faster rule-matching.
- IMPROVED: Small resolution support for modals.

## [0.46.1] - 2025-04-24

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: `Json` configuration import.
- FIXED: Front-end styles for `ROG` and `TUF` design.
- ADDED: `DNAT` support for `dokodemo‑door` inbounds bound to a specific listen address (anything other than `0.0.0.0`)—those rules now use `-j DNAT --to-destination` instead of a generic `REDIRECT`.
- ADDED: Source‑subnet filtering in client mode—all `dokodemo-door` REDIRECT/TPROXY rules are now prefixed with `-s <local_lan_subnet>`, so only LAN traffic is captured.
- ADDED: listen‑address restriction for server inbounds—ACCEPT rules for `non‑0.0.0.0` binds now include `-d <listen_ip>`, limiting them to the configured interface.
- ADDED: Filtering options for logs by source, target, inbound, and outbound in Logs component.
- ADDED: a new CLI command `xrayui diagnostics iptables` to display diagnostics routing information.
- IMPROVED: Moved logs window to a modal.

## [0.45.0] - 2025-04-21

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: A `password` field and generation functionality to `Shadowsocks` inbound form.
- ADDED: New option under General Settings — `Clients Online Status Check`. This feature is disabled by default. When enabled, XRAYUI will actively check which clients are currently connected to Xray.
- REMOVED: XRAYUI no longer relies on Xray installed via Entware. It now fetches the latest version directly from the official [Xray-core repository](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases) on GitHub.
- IMPROVED: Prerelease and draft versions of `Xray Core` are now excluded from the update list.
- IMPROVED: Update response handling and improve loading progress management.
- IMPROVED: Enhanced the Xray version switch module to support switching to a specific version or the latest release. Use `xrayui update xray xx.xx.xx` or `xrayui update xray latest` to switch Xray-core versions directly from the CLI.
- IMPROVED: Enhance response handling with cache-busting and improve service restart logic.

## [0.44.3] - 2025-04-20

- IMPROVED: Fine-tuned dnsmasq configuration handling for better log management. The XRAYUI now conditionally appends logging directives (`log-queries`, `log-async`, and `log-facility`) only if they are not already present, ensuring idempotent and non-intrusive updates. This prevents duplicate entries and respects existing user settings while enabling useful diagnostic logging when the dnsmasq option is enabled.
- ADDED: `ADDON_DEBUG` flag (values: 0 or 1) to xrayui.conf, enabling optional diagnostic output for advanced debugging. Can be set manually by editing the file.
- ADDED: A new `Skip testing XRAY` option under General Options. This allows users to bypass the XRAY configuration test step. While the test can help diagnose issues with the configuration file, it may consume system resources—so disabling it can improve performance on low-end routers.

## [0.44.1] - 2025-04-18

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: A critical compatibility issue with the `Diversion` module. `XrayUI` and `Diversion` now correctly detect and synchronize the `dnsmasq` logging state, preventing duplicate or conflicting log entries when you enable or disable dnsmasq logging in either module.
  > _Note: If you’ve already turned on `dnsmasq` logging in `Diversion`, enabling it afterward in XrayUI works perfectly; the modules will detect the existing settings and avoid duplicates. However, if you first enable `dnsmasq` logging in `XrayUI` and then go into `Diversion` and enable it there, you will end up with conflicting log directives and potential DNS service failures. To prevent this, only manage dnsmasq logging from one module—either Diversion or XrayUI—but not both._
- IMPROVED: Refactored the internal logging system for better maintainability and clarity.
- IMPROVED: Added checks for any inbound `TProxy` flags when increasing the maximum file descriptor limit.

## [0.44.0] - 2025-04-18

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Option to automatically clear logs on `XRAY` service restart.
- ADDED: Configurable log size limit in general settings. When the file exceeds the defined size, it will be rotated automatically.
- ADDED: Automatic geosite update toggle in general settings. When enabled, the job will update geodata files nightly.
- IMPROVED: Log parsing logic for better accuracy.
- FIXED: `Logrotate` cron job now reliably created during installation.
- REMOVED: `daily` and `compress` directives from logrotate configuration to prevent unnecessary log rotation and reduce overhead.

## [0.43.3] - 2025-04-17

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: Connected clients were not displayed correctly due to improper parsing of the access log.
- IMPROVED: Added calls to restart the `dnsmasq` service after enabling or disabling logging, ensuring the changes take effect immediately.
- IMPROVED: Enhanced log output.

## [0.43.1] - 2025-04-16

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: an issue where non-object `DNS server entries` (like string addresses) were being dropped from the configuration.
- FIXED: Ensure correct profile is used for data operations in backend.
- FIXED: Logs parsing.
- ADDED: A new checkbox in `General Settings` to enable `dnsmasq` logging. When enabled, `dnsmasq` logs will be activated and IP addresses in the xray access logs will be replaced with the corresponding domain names.

## [0.43.0] - 2025-04-14

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: `General Settings` were not updating the current profile.
- FIXED: Unable to enable logging when using the default import.
- ADDED: Feature to associate `DNS` servers with specific routing rules (available in `Advanced mode`) to simplify domain management.
- ADDED: `Import JSON` – Use this option when you have a client configuration file that you want to import into the router. The configuration will be automatically adjusted for compatibility with your router.
- ADDED: `Restore from File` (Import) – Use this option to upload a previously working configuration file as is, without modifications.
- ADDED: Restoring from a previously created backup is now supported.
- IMPROVED: Refactored the `service_event` case statement in xrayui for better structure and readability.
- IMPROVED: Refactored `Backup Manager`.

## [0.42.7] - 2025-04-06

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: Resolved installation freeze issues in the web UI.
- FIXED: Configuration changes are now saved to the default profile (`config.json`) instead of the active profile.
- ADDED: Introduced the `xrayui update x.xx.x` argument to install a specific version; leaving it blank installs the latest version.

## [0.41.0] - 2025-03-22

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- CHANGED: `Client/Server` mode. XRAYUI now operates as a single proxy service on the router. This is a critical change that might affect some configurations. This change means that `XRAYUI` can configure `XRAY` to act as both a server and a client simultaneously. External devices can now connect to your home network, while local devices continue to be routed through the external VPS. In client mode, `XRAYUI` still expects at least one `dokodemo` inbound. Please report any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/issues) if you encounter any.
- CHANGED: `logrotate`: use configurable log file paths for access and error logs.
- CHANGED: Switched to `SCSS`.
- FIXED: Ensured that `shortId` is generated correctly.
- FIXED: Reset the `XRAY` versions list before loading new data.
- FIXED: Display log times in local time zone and improve log entry parsing.
- ADDED: It is now possible to specify a custom logs location in the general settings.
- ADDED: Configuration Profiles. You can now easily switch between configuration files using a new selection option in the Main Configuration section. This option dynamically lists all available JSON configuration files from the `/opt/etc/xray` directory, enabling quick and flexible profile management.
- IMPROVED: Default settings are now correctly applied for proxy configurations.

## [0.40.0] - 2025-03-11

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: You can now update the `XRAY-CORE` binaries directly from the official repository. Click on the Xray-core version (on the top right corner) to open the `switch` modal window and initiate the update.
- ADDED: Reverse proxy UI support. A new section `Reverse Proxy` has been added. When adding `bridge` or `portal` items to the reverse configuration, you can immediately reference them in `routing` configuration.

## [0.39.1] - 2025-03-06

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: Importing an `mKCP` configuration.
- FIXED: Numeric values in the `mKCP` saved as strings.
  > _(If you had non-default values set for KCP, we recommend first reverting them to default values, applying the configuration, and then setting them to your desired values. This will reconvert previously saved values to numeric types.)_
- ADDED: A new `Configuration for packet header obfuscation` field to the `mKCP` configuration.

## [0.39.0] - 2025-03-05

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Support for detailed importing of configuration links for `Vmess`, `Shadowsocks`, and `Trojan`.
  - **Vmess:** Configuration links are decoded. All essential connection parameters (such as server address, port, UUID, and network settings) are extracted.
  - **Shadowsocks:** Encrypted user credentials are decoded to retrieve the encryption method and password.
  - **Trojan:** Connection details, including host, port, and security settings, are accurately parsed.
- IMPROVED: General frontend code refactor/cleanup.
- FIXED: Add a delay before fetching Xray response data on page initial load.

## [0.38.3] - 2025-02-25

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: Resolved an issue where sorting rules were not applied correctly in the final rules array.
  > Please reapply your settings (no additional changes needed).
- FIXED: The page now remains responsive even when there is no internet connection.

## [0.38.2] - 2025-02-24

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: an exclusion rule for `NTP` traffic (UDP port `123`), preventing time synchronization services from being inadvertently redirected to `xray`.
- FIXED: an issue where logs were not correctly parsed in `xray-core 25.2`.
- REMOVED: the loading window that appeared on page load, improving the user experience.
- ADDED: a visible character counter showing current `config.json` size, helping users keep track of the configuration file limit.

## [0.38.1] - 2025-02-20

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: a new version window fix.

## [0.38.0] - 2025-02-20

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: When a new version is available, an update modal automatically appears on page load. The modal includes a `Don't want to update` button which, when clicked, dismisses the modal and prevents future notifications for that specific version.
- ADDED: a new filter text box to filter the big list of devices (appears next to `Show all devices` checkbox).
- IMPROVED: Enhanced X-RAY `access` log display. Access logs now show the source device name (if available) and the target domain name (if available), providing clearer context for connections. **This is not precise though**.

## [0.37.1] - 2025-02-19

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: A confusing description under the `Devices` field in the `Redirect/Bypass` manager.
- ADDED: A scrollbar to the `Devices` field to correctly display a large list of devices.
- UPDATED: Renamed `Device policies` to the `Redirect/Bypass policies` in the `Routing` section.

## [0.37.0] - 2025-02-18

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g. **Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: a bug where editing a rule changed its position in the list.
- FIXED: a bug that prevented disabling the connection status check in the `General Options`.
- FIXED: a bug where a geosite URL was replaced with a geoip URL.
  > _Important: Double-check your geosite URL. You may need to revert it to its original source._
- ADDED: When Xray runs in `TPROXY` mode, the maximum number of open file descriptors is automatically raised to `65535` to accommodate high connection counts.
- ADDED: Introduced per-device “bypass” and “redirect” policies in both `NAT` (REDIRECT) and `TPROXY` modes.
  - `Bypass` policies now only proxy the specified ports and return all other traffic.
  - `Redirect` policies proxy all traffic except for the listed ports.
    This change unifies behavior between NAT and TPROXY and allows you to configure fine-grained rules per device.
    > _Important: Since the previous setting `Ports redirect/bypass policy` has been removed, you may need to adjust your settings in the new `Device policies` manager._

## [0.36.0] - 2025-02-12

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: It is now possible to `activate` or `deactivate` a rule by clicking a checkbox next to its name in the Routing Rules list.
- ADDED: Display of the `X-Ray Core` process uptime, showing how long the process has been running.

- ADDED: General Options window to control settings such as logs, geodata source URLs, etc.
- FIXED: Incorrect modal window translation in general settings.
- FIXED: A bug where pressing the reconnect button spawned a new X-Ray process instead of restarting the existing one.
- UPDATED: When importing a configuration, DNS settings now revert to their default values (`queryStrategy` set to `UseIP` and `domainStrategy` set to `AsIs`).
- REMOVED: DNS `queryStrategy=UseIP` from the configuration, as it is now the default.
- REMOVED: Refactored the `Logs` section to display only logs; other settings were moved into the `General Options` window for log management.

## [0.35.3] - 2025-02-10

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Support for older `Shadowsocks` encryption methods (`aes-256-gcm`, `aes-128-gcm`, `chacha20-ietf-poly1305`, `none`, and `plain`), alongside the recommended 2022 ciphers.
- CHANGED: Improved password generation logic, setting the password to an empty string for encryption methods that require no key.

## [0.35.2] - 2025-02-09

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: An `edit` button to edit existing proxy users.
- UPDATED: Swapped tags and proxy labels in the `Inbounds` and `Outbounds` display.

- ADDED: Language support.

## [0.34.3] - 2025-02-06

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- FIXED: Resolved an issue during configuration import where routing rules were incorrectly assigned to a default `proxy` tag instead of the imported one (#21).
- ADDED: Introduced an `Outbound` column to the routing rules list for improved clarity.

## [0.34.2] - 2025-02-05

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Ability to define an array of users on the routing rule level. The rule will now take effect when the source user's email matches any address in the array.
- FIXED: Resolved an issue where QR code PNG images with transparent backgrounds could not be read.
- FIXED: Addressed a warning in the `import manager` related to replacing a configuration when the full config import checkbox was unchecked.
- IMPROVED: Enhanced the inbound/outbound tag editing so that any changes are now automatically propagated to the corresponding rules.
- UPDATED: Relocated XRAYUI options (`Check Connection` and `Restart on Reboot`) to the General Options window.

## [0.34.0] - 2025-02-05

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Version command to display the current XRAYUI version. Usage: `/jffs/scripts/xrayui version`.
- ADDED: Symlink to `/jffs/scripts/xrayui` for direct invocation of `xrayui`.
- ADDED: XRAYUI configuration file (`/opt/etc/xrayui.conf`) to allow specifying custom community `geosite` and `geoip` URLs.
- FIXED: `HTTP` Inbound type error in the `allowTransparent` property.
- FIXED: Custom geodata tag files were not loaded properly.
- FIXED: Unable to delete large custom geodata files.
- REMOVED: Constraints on the address field that prevented entering domain names.
- UPDATED: Due to limitations in `curl` on some routers, the connection-check logic was moved from the server-side to the client-side, and the endpoint was switched from `freeapi.com` to `ip-api.com`.

## [0.33.0] - 2025-02-04

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- UPDATED: Introduced a `General options` row in the `Configuration` section.
- ADDED: A new option, `Check connection to xray server`, in the `General options` section of Client mode. Enabling it allows XRAYUI to check the connection status of the outbound proxy. After restarting Xray, the check sends a connection request to an external service ([freeipapi.com](https://freeipapi.com)) to verify that the connection is truly established via the outbound proxy. Next to the status, a flag representing the X-RAY outbound server `country` location appears to indicate the connection status. Please note that it takes a couple of seconds after restart to validate the connection. When this option is enabled, XRAYUI automatically adds some system configurations (an inbound `SOCKS` proxy and a system routing rule).
- ADDED: A new modal window for browsing the raw Xray configuration file. It replaces the old `show config` button in the `Configuration` section. You can now view a nicely formatted JSON version of your configuration and choose to hide sensitive data before copying and sharing it. However, it is still recommended reviewing the configuration carefully before sharing to ensure that no sensitive information is accidentally exposed.
- IMPROVED: Compliance with `Codacy` code standards.

## [0.32.1] - 2025-02-02

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: When importing a new client configuration, it is now possible to select the services to unblock. They will automatically be added to the `routing rules`, so there's no need to set them up manually later.
- ADDED: A checkbox `Don't break my network devices` in the `import configuration` window. This will set the default mode to `bypass`, potentially preventing disruption to `IoT` devices on the network.
- FIXED: Correctly display advanced `DNS` server name when defined.
- FIXED: The `bypass`/`redirect` mode dropdown value sometimes remains unchanged.
- FIXED: A bug with loading display function was not resolved.
- FIXED: Implement normalization methods for TLS security protocol classes and update interfaces.
- REMOVED: Unused/abandoned parts of the code.
- IMPROVED: Mounting of the menu during installation.
- IMPROVED: Minor cosmetic fixes and changes.

## [0.31.1] - 2025-01-30

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: `transport` and `secururity` labels for Outbounds proxies.
- IMPROVED: visual `proxy`, `transport` and `security` labels.
- IMPROVED: Enhanced the visual loading and waiting display for a smoother user experience.

## [0.31.0] - 2025-01-29

> _Important: Please clear your browser cache (e.g.**Ctrl+F5**) to ensure that outdated files are updated._

- ADDED: Display selected mode in the `Ports Bypass/Redirect Policy`.
- ADDED: A new `Logs` section to monitor the Xray logs from the web UI.
- UPDATED: Moved the outbounds `import` button to the `Configuration` section.
- IMPROVED: Completely refactored the process of importing a new configuration connection in a `client` mode. The Import row has been migrated to the `Configuration` section and is now located under `Import Config File`. In the import modal, a new checkbox titled `I'd like to have a complete setup!` has been introduced. Enabling this option will create all required and missing configuration options (Inbounds, Outbounds, DNS settings etc.) when importing a server connection URL, allowing to set up a complete Xray client configuration with a single click. **Note: Enabling this will overwrite all previous configurations**.
- IMPROVED: Enhanced the visual loading and waiting display for a smoother user experience.
- IMPROVED: Removed the `TCP fragmentation` checkbox from the FREEDOM proxy and simplified the fragment packet method handling.

## [0.30.0] - 2025-01-26

- IMPROVED: Overall refactoring. The `xrayui` code now has a [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5afa683e2930418a9b13efac6537aad8)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade), which required many fixes and changes. See [pull request](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/pull/8).
- ADDED: `logrotate` setup to manage xray log file growth over time.
- FIXED: Wrong `netstat` package name, replaced with `net-tools-netstat`.
- UPDATED: GitHub action to follow build standards.
- UPDATED: Bumped `golang` version to `1.22.2` following security recommendations.

## [0.29.1] - 2025-01-24

- ADDED: `Custom GEODATA Files Manager`. A new button labeled `Manage Local Files` has been added to the `Routing` section. This feature allows you to store rule-based domain and IP lists in standalone geodat files (similar to geosite.dat and geoip.dat). You can compile these files directly from the router's web interface. Assign a tag (e.g., `discord`), and after compiling, use it in the routing rules as `ext:xrayui:discord`.
- ADDED: `Cache-Control` meta tag with a `no-cache` value. This addition attempts to combat Asus web caching mechanisms.
- IMPROVED: Enhanced the installation process by checking for and installing missing `Entware` dependencies before installing XrayUI. The required dependencies now include `sed`, `jq`, `iptables`, `netstat`, `openssl`, and `flock`.
- UPDATED: Modernized the `DOCTYPE` declaration and HTML structure by replacing Asus's `XHTML 1.0 Transitional` with `HTML5` standards.
- FIXED: Resolved a bug in the `Ports Bypass/Redirect Policy` that previously prevented saving empty ports fields.
- FIXED: Corrected issues with the fixme command to ensure it functions as intended.
- FIXED: wrong opkg package check during the installation (openssl should be libopenssl)
- IMPROVED: Ensured that all necessary Merlin script files are executable, addressing issue #7.

## [0.28.0] - 2025-01-22

- ADDED: **IMPORTANT!** For Xray in client mode, a new option called `Ports Bypass/Redirect Policy` has been added to the routing section. This controls how the router manages traffic to different ports. By default, it is set to `redirect` mode, meaning all traffic is redirected to the Xray inbound port. You can add ports to the exclusion list if certain ports should not be handled by Xray. When switching to `bypass` mode, all traffic bypasses Xray, and you can specify ports that should be redirected to Xray. This feature allows for fine-tuning traffic management to Xray directly from the web interface.
- ADDED: A `60-second` waiting period on startup to ensure that Xray starts at the correct time, after applying `iptables` rules.
- FIXED: The Xray server IP is no longer exposed in the logs.

## [0.27.1] - 2025-01-22

- ADDED: `Iptables` rules to ignore Steam/Playstation/XBOX/EGS ports.
- FIXED: Correctly display `Clients Online` in server mode.

- ADDED: Emergency function `/jffs/scripts/xrayui` fixme to automatically address unexpected `xrayui` issues.
- UPDATED: Refactored stream settings handling and normalization for various proxy types.
- UPDATED: Made the `spiderX` field visible in `REALITY` while in client mode.
- IMPROVED: Enhanced error message output on the Xray-Core router side when xray fails to start. Now a friendly `yellow exclamation` mark indicates what went wrong.
- IMPROVED: Updated default configuration handling to avoid saving default xray parameters, thus reducing noise and file size.
- IMPROVED: Fixed a residual payload issue in `custom_settings` (#2, #7).
- IMPROVED: Normalized the `Sniffing` object when saving settings.
- IMPROVED: Removed the entire `sockopt` entity when it is turned `off`.
- IMPROVED: Added more user-friendly messages and improved validation during `QR` generation.
- FIXED: Removed the hardcoded server port in the connected clients list for server mode (#6).
- FIXED: The security object now correctly retains its default setting visually (`REALITY`, `TLS` - cosmetic fix).
- FIXED: Corrected mapping for inbound types during configuration load.
- FIXED: When the `sockopt.mark` field is empty, it is removed rather than being set as a string.

## [0.26.1] - 2025-01-20

- UPDATED: Added custom firewall script hooks for both `TPROXY` and `DIRECT` modes, executed before final interception rules are applied. This ensures user-defined rules (e.g., WAN interface exclusions) are processed in time.
- ADDED: Display a hint next to the geodata files update button indicating when the files were last updated.
- ADDED: DNAT-based exclusion in `TPROXY` rules to bypass inbound port-forwards (#4).

- IMPROVED: Refactor routing object sotring in json to be optional and update normalization logic.

## [0.22.1] - 2025-01-16

- FIXED: The `Toggle Xray startup on reboot` checkbox occasionally reverted to its previous state.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-01-15

- ADDED: An option to toggle Xray startup on router reboot (enable/disable) (available under `Connection Status`).
