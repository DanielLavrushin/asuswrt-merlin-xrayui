## Requirements

### SSH Access

Access your router via SSH to execute installation commands.

### Prerequisites

- [Merlin firmware](https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/download) (`384.15` or later, `3006.102.1` or later)
- [Entware](https://github.com/Entware/Entware/wiki/Install-on-Asus-stock-firmware) installed
  - you can use built-in [amtm](https://diversion.ch/amtm.html) tool to install `Entware`

## Installation

To install the latest version of `ASUSWRT Merlin XrayUI`, simply run the following command in your routerâ€™s SSH terminal:

```shell
wget -O /tmp/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui.tar.gz https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/releases/latest/download/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui.tar.gz && rm -rf /jffs/addons/xrayui && tar -xzf /tmp/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui.tar.gz -C /jffs/addons && mv /jffs/addons/xrayui/xrayui /jffs/scripts/xrayui && chmod 0777 /jffs/scripts/xrayui && sh /jffs/scripts/xrayui install
```

### How to uninstall

To uninstall and clean up run the command

```shell
/jffs/scripts/xrayui uninstall
```

## Usage

### Post-Installation Steps

- Log Out and Back In: After installing, log out from the router's browser UI and then log back in.
- Access the X-RAY Tab: Navigate to the `VPN` menu item in the router's web UI and look for the new tab labeled `X-RAY`.

## Custom Scripts for Firewall Rules/IPTABLES

You can enhance the flexibility of your `Xray` configuration by adding custom scripts to handle specific firewall rules during Xray startup and shutdown.
These scripts should be placed in the `/jffs/xrayui_custom` directory and named according to their purpose:

- `firewall_server` - Executed when Xray starts in server mode.
- `firewall_client` - Executed when Xray starts in client mode.
- `firewall_cleanup` - Executed when Xray stops.
  Ensure the scripts are executable (`chmod +x <script>`).

## FAQ

**Q: Telegram group?**

A: [![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3128e51b-ecaf-4b1e-baf9-74876ba67589)](https://t.me/asusxray)

**Q: Can I import my VPS x-ray connection string?**

A: Yes, you can, and this is even preferable method to start x-ray in a client mode on your router. [Read this guide](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/wiki/Xray-Client-Importing-the-Configuration) for more details.

**Q: What if I already have an Xray configuration?**

A: If you already have an Xray configuration file that you want to use, you need to place it in the following location:

```
/opt/etc/xray/config.json
```

Once the file is placed here, the ASUSWRT Merlin XrayUI interface will automatically reflect the changes.

**Q: What is Bypass/Redirect Policy?**

A: The [Bypass/Redirect Policy](https://github.com/DanielLavrushin/asuswrt-merlin-xrayui/wiki/Bypass-Redirect-Policy-Overview) is a set of rules that determines how network traffic is handled by Xray on a per-port or per-device basis.
